# Regular-Expressions

In my assigned assignment scope, each student will present/teach in class a chapter focusing on R in R (2e) Regular Expressions for Data Science (Chapter 15 on R4DS) with an extra creation example.
Within the scope of this task, my part was the Introduction, Prerequisities and Pattern Basics sections from chapter 15. 
In this file, quatro and markdown files were made within the scope of these topics and this topic was presented with my own examples in the course.
